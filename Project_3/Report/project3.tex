\section{Weighted A Star}
Weighted A Star influences how important the heuristic is in the creation of an f score for a node. The weight is a multiplier on to the h(s), in the form of f(s) = g(s) + w* h(s) 
\subsection{Uniform Cost Search}
Uniform Cost Search is a form of weighted A star with a weight of Zero
